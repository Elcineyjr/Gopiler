# Gopiler
A compiler for simple Go programs. This is a project proposed as part of the Compilers course at UFES by the Professor Eduardo Zambon.

## How to run

Open the terminal and compile the parser with
```bash
make
```

Run it by either providing a file 
```bash
make run FILE=<file_path>
```

or running on all files from the tests folder
```bash
sh runall.sh
```
